# Bluetooth ( BlueDot ) Controlled Raspberry Pi Robot ....

1. Coded in python with the use of RPi.GPIO module to interact with  GPIO pins ..

2.  GIPO pins are then connected to L293N Motor Driver .... the L293N is fed with a separate 9V supply

3.  Four BO Motors ( Simple DC motor with plastic gear and wheel) are connected to L293N 

4 . Separate functions are being created for performing various functions ... 
      Like RunF() to move forward, RunB() to move Backword ...
      For turning the funda of Differential Speeds through TurnR() and TurnL() functions 
      
5. Bluetooth Connections are achieved useding Open Source BluDot Module 

6. The Standard  BlueDot Android App ( Available in Play Store )  is used as a Remote Controller



   PS : It's a simple exampalory code to demonstrate the use of BlueDot with Raspberry Pi .. it can be build upon with Swipe functions and speed depends on lenght of swipe  etc
