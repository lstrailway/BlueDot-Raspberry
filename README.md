# Bluetooth Controled Robot ....

Coded in python with the used of RPi.GPIO module to send various commands to GPIO pins ..

Separate functions are being created for performing various functions ... 
Like RunF to move forward, RunB to move Backword ...
For turning the funda of differential speeds through TurnR() and TurnL() functions 

Bluetooth Connections are achieved useding Open Source BluDot Module .. and standard BlueDot Android app is used as a remoted controller for the Robo- Go - Cart



It's a simple exampalory code to demonstrate the use of BlueDot with Raspberry Pi .. it can be build up with Swipe functions and speed depends upon lenght of swipe
